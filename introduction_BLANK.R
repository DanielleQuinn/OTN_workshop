# ---- Running Code ----
# On windows, Ctrl - Enter to run a line of code
# On Mac Cmd-Enter

# ---- R is a calculator ----

# ---- Conditional Operators ----
# Is 5 equal to 5?

# Is 5 equal to 6?

# Is 5 greater than 6?

# Is 5 greater than or equal to 6?

# Is 5 not equal to 6?

# Is 5 equal to 5 AND 7 greater than 6?

# Is 5 equal to 5 OR 7 greater than 10?

# ---- Functions ----
# Goal: Find the square root of 81

# Goal: Find the square root of the square root of 81

# Functions require specific types of arguments

# ---- Packages ----
# Packages are collections of functions built by other users

# Step One: Download & install the package to your local library

# Step Two: Access the package's functions from the local library

# ---- Finding Help ----
# Option 1: Google
# Option 2: Cheat Sheet
# Option 3: Ask R

# ---- Objects ----
# Goal: Find and use the value of pi

# Goal: Make an object called x that contains the value 15

# Goal: Make an object called y that contains the value of x plus 3

# ---- Data Classes ----
# Numeric

# Character

# Logical

# ---- Data Structures: Vectors ----
# Vector
# Goal: Put all integers between 1 and 10 into the object called myvector

# Goal: Apply a function to all elements in a vector

# Is each element in myvector greater than 5?

# Is 11 found in this vector?

# Goal: How many elements are in the vector called myvector?

# Goal: Create a vector called myseq that contains all odd numbers between 1 and 300.

# Goal: Create a vector called numbers that contains the numbers 1, 6, 3, 4, and 10

# Goal: Create a vector called fruit that contains the words apple, orange, and kiwi

# Goal: Create a vector called tests that contains TRUE and FALSE

# ---- Indexing ----
# Goal: What is the 10th element in myseq?

# Goal: What are the 10th through 15th elements in myseq?

# Goal: What are the 2nd, 4th, and 18th elements in myseq?

# ---- Characteristics of Vectors ----
# Vectors are "atomic": they can only contain one class of data

# Implication: You can't mix characters and numbers

# Goal: What is the average number of eggs?

# Converting vectors

# Goal: What is the average/minimum/maximum number of eggs?

# ---- Dealing with NAs ----
# Missing values are represented by NA

# ---- Data Structures: Data Frames ----
# Goal: Create a data frame with a column called "one" containing the values 1 to 5
# and a column called "two" containing the letters a to e. Call this data frame mydata

# In standard R syntax, you can extract a column of a data frame as a vector using $

# ---- Importing Data ----
# Goal: Import a .txt file

## Step One: Tell R where to look

## Step Two: Load the data
