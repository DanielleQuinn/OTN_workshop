### Set Up Instructions  

1. Install R by downloading and running [this .exe file](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm), which can also be found on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html).  

2. Install the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) by selecting the 1.2.1335 version appropriate for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux/Ubuntu).  

*Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later, for example when installing R packages.*
